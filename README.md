# About project
**To use this application you must enable the browsers location information, otherwise the map won't load**

This application is for you to keep up with your workouts. You can click in any location in the map and add markup by filling up the form of workout details.
The map will be automatically rendered and centered at your current geological location where you open this app. This is because we get the location each time the app is opened through js "navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()" method.  At the moment, there is only
two workkout type you can add and they are "Running" and "Cycling".

All the added workouts will be added to browsers localstorage, so they will be waiting you for till you come back. To delete permanently workouts, use the "Delete all workouts " button.


I made this project through one of my javacript courses taken online. It is still unfinished since I want to add more functionalities in the application, such ass route lines between workouts.
So updates coming in future. â˜º
